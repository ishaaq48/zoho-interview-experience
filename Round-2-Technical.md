# üß† Zoho Interview ‚Äì Round 2 (Coding Questions)

Below are the **actual coding questions** I faced during my Zoho interview process. They test your grasp on arrays, strings, matrices, logic, and problem-solving.

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Shift Even and Odd Numbers
**Problem:** Move even numbers to the beginning in ascending order, odd numbers to the end in descending order.  
**Input:** `[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]`  
**Output:** `[2, 4, 5, 3, 1]`

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Next Largest Element at Each Index  
**Problem:** For each element, find the next greater element to its right.  
**Input:** `[4, 5, 2, 10, 8]`  
**Output:** `[5, 8, 4, -1, -1]`

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Pattern Matrix from Word  
**Problem:** Create a matrix with a repeated word and increasing row-wise numbers  
(*Example given with word 'zoho' and pattern of index increment*)

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Rotate Matrix by 90¬∞  
**Problem:** Given a square matrix, rotate it 90 degrees clockwise.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Insert Substring to Form Palindrome  
**Problem:** Given `s1` and `s2`, insert s2 into s1 such that the result is a shortest palindrome.  
**Example:**  
`s1 = abaccabba`, `s2 = acbba` ‚Üí `accbba`

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Construct Binary Search Tree  
**Problem:** Construct a BST from given elements.

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Count Subarrays with K Distinct Elements  
**Problem:** Print subarrays with exactly K distinct elements and return the count.  
**Input:** `[1, 2, 1, 3, 4]`, `K = 3`  
**Output:** `3`

---

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters  
**Input:** `abcabcbb`  
**Output:** `3` (abc)

---

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ Find Missing Number  
**Problem:** Given a range 0 to n, find the missing number.

---

### üîü Index of First Non-Repeating Character  
**Input:** `"leetcode"`  
**Output:** `0`

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Palindrome Check  
**Problem:** Check if a given string is a palindrome.

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ Find Second Largest Element  
**Problem:** Find the second largest element in an array.

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ Pathfinding in Grid  
**Problem:** Find a valid path in a 2D grid with directions or weights (example in image).

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ Overlapping Interval Path  
**Problem:** Given intervals, find overlapping regions.  
**Input:** `[[1, 2], [5, 10], [4, 6]]`  
**Output:** `[5, 6]`  
**Input:** `[[1, 3], [5, 8], [6, 9]]`  
**Output:** `-1`

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ Spiral Matrix  
**Problem:** Given a matrix, print elements in spiral order.

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£6Ô∏è‚É£ Product in Matrix Equals K  
**Input:**  
[ [2, 5, 2],
[3, 4, 8],
[1, 3, 4] ]

`K = 8`  
**Output:** Positions where product in any direction equals 8.
