# 🔧 Zoho Interview – Round 3 (Technical Task / Mini Project)

This round involved building a small real-world Java application. The focus was on:
- Class design and object-oriented principles (OOP)
- Java I/O operations
- Logic building and edge case handling
- Clean CLI-based user experience
- Thinking under pressure

---

### 💼 Task 1: Task Manager Application

**Overview:**  
Design a CLI-based task management app with features like:
- Creating tasks with optional priority
- Subtasks support
- Viewing tasks and subtasks
- Searching tasks
- Writing task content to a file

**Core Concepts Tested:**
- Class design with constructors and inheritance
- Java Collections (ArrayList, HashMap)
- File handling using `FileWriter`
- Scanner-based CLI interactions
- Priority management and category tagging

**Sample Menu:**
1. Task Creation
2. View Tasks
3. Create Subtask
4. View Subtasks
5. Search
6. Add task content in file
7. Stop Program

> ✅ They tested how I structured classes, handled subtasks, and managed the file I/O operations. At the end, they asked me to make **small changes under time pressure**, like modifying how data is searched, updating task IDs dynamically, etc.

### 💰 Task 2: Bank Application System (From Another Attempt)

**Overview:**
A simplified bank system where the user can:
- Register and log in (with basic encryption or masking)
- Add balance / Withdraw
- View transaction history
- Handle edge cases like incorrect logins or insufficient balance

**Core Concepts Tested:**
- Java Classes and Object Management
- Basic encryption (e.g., masking passwords or simple hashing logic)
- File or memory-based transaction record maintenance
- Realistic login and customer creation flow

**Additional Details:**
- They asked specific **"what if" edge cases** like:
  - Invalid login retry logic
  - Transaction limits
  - Dynamic balance update
- Though logic was straightforward, some **corner cases were tricky** and required thinking.

---

### ✨ Tips for Candidates

1. **Practice building mini-projects in Java** (CLI-based apps).
2. **Think about edge cases** — input validation, ID mismatches, duplicate entries.
3. **Follow object-oriented principles** — break logic into methods and reusable classes.
4. Use `Scanner` for CLI, `FileWriter` or `BufferedWriter` for file I/O.

---

### 💡 My Learnings

- Time pressure is part of the test. Think aloud and break problems into smaller methods.
- Don’t panic if asked to make changes mid-way — keep your code modular and clean.
- Focus on **clarity over complexity** — simple code that works is better than smart code that breaks.
